To create dynamic drop down and update selected values inside table. { Data will fetch from the API } 

+++++++++++++ Documents ++++++++++++++++

let's set up the component to follow the scenario you described:

-> Only the first object in responseArray has a value key, which is an array of values.
-> Each dropdown's value depends on the previous dropdown's selection.
-> Add selections to a table where table headers correspond to the dropdowns’ name properties.

Explanation
State Management:

selectedOptions holds the current selection for each dropdown.
tableData stores all added rows for the table.
Dropdown Rendering:

For the first dropdown (index 0), options are taken directly from responseArray[0].value.
For the rest of the dropdowns, options are derived based on dependencyData and the previous dropdown’s selection.
Add to Table:

Clicking the "Add to Table" button adds the current selections to tableData and clears selectedOptions.
Dynamic Dependencies:

The getOptions function fetches dependent options based on selectedOptions and dependencyData, where each child dropdown relies on the selected value of its parent dropdown.
This component allows you to easily modify responseArray and dependencyData to accommodate different data structures while maintaining dropdown dependencies. The table dynamically updates with the names and values based on selections from these dropdowns.


///////// API  Integration 


Creating a dynamic dropdown and table component in React based on an initial array of objects (responseArray) involves several key steps:

Initializing dropdowns from responseArray, where the first dropdown has its options directly from the value array at index 0.
Fetching options for dependent dropdowns based on selections from the previous dropdown.
Adding the selected dropdown values to a table, with dynamic column headers based on the name properties of the dropdowns.


Explanation
State Initialization:

dropdownValues: An array to store the options for each dropdown.
selectedOptions: Tracks the currently selected option for each dropdown.
tableRows: Stores selected options to display in the table.
Effect Hook for Initial Dropdown:

Populates the options of the first dropdown directly from responseArray[0].value.
Dropdown Selection Handler:

When a dropdown selection changes, it updates selectedOptions and fetches options for the next dropdown.
The fetchOptions function is assumed to return options based on the selected value and the key of the next dropdown.
Adding to Table:

When the "Add to Table" button is clicked, the selected values are stored in tableRows, creating a new row with each column corresponding to the dropdowns in responseArray.


Explanation of fetchOptions
This is a mock API function that simulates fetching dropdown options based on the selected value of the previous dropdown.
Customize fetchOptions to fetch real data, using fetch() or an API library like Axios for asynchronous requests.
This approach should allow for flexible dropdown and table generation based on dynamic API responses.
